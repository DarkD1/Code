# COLLECTION OF MY CODE
<h1><a href="https://github.com/sazzadshopno/Code/tree/master/Algorithm%20Design">Algorithm Design</a></h1>
In this folder there are many algorithm's written in programming language C++. These algorithm's were in my academic syllabus.

> <b>Graph Bicoloring:</b> Vertex coloring is the most common graph coloring problem. The problem is, given 2 colors, if there exist a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are colored using same color you should print "BICOLORABLE", "NOT BICOLORABLE" otherwise.

> <b>Binary Search:</b> Given a sorted array of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in array.

> <b>Find Max and Min:</b> Using Divide and Conquer, Find the max and min element of given array.

> <b>Mergesort:</b> Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves.

> <b>Quicksort:</b> QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x

> <b>Sum of Subset:</b> Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.

> <b>Dijkstra Algorithm:</b> Given a graph and a source vertex in the graph, find shortest paths from source to all vertices in the given graph.

> <b>Heapsort:</b> Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for remaining element. 

> <b>Krushkal Algorithm:</b> Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph adding increasing cost arcs at each step.

> <b>NQueen:</b> The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

> <b>Selection Sort:</b> The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

> <b>Travelling Salesman:</b> Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.
